The problem does not state whether $\mu$ or $\mu'$ are the
coefficients of static or kinetic friction.  We will assume that $\mu$
is static (otherwise the blocks would be moving relative to each
other, which means they are slipping,) and that $\mu'$ is kinetic
(otherwise they are not moving at all.)

The block of mass $m$ will slip if the force of friction between the
two blocks can not give it the same acceleration as the block of mass
$M$.  We solve for the more general case in part (ii) and obtain (i)
by setting $\mu' = 0$.  We have
\begin{align*}
  -kx + mg\mu + (m+M)g\mu' &= MA \\
  -mg\mu &= ma
\end{align*}
and we wish to know when $A \lt a$ (since the accelerations are
negative.)

Now, $m$ has maximum negative acceleration $a = -g\mu$.  If $a$ and
$A$ are just equal then
\begin{align*}
-kx + mg\mu + (m+M)g\mu' &= -Mg\mu \\
x &= \frac{-Mg\mu - mg\mu - (m+M)g\mu'}{-k} \\
&= g\frac{M\mu + m\mu + (m+M)\mu'}{k} \\
&= g\frac{(m+M)\mu + (m+M)\mu'}{k} \\
&= g\frac{(m+M)(\mu+\mu')}{k}
\end{align*}
